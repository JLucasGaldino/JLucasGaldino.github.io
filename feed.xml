The act of writing down my thoughts helps me empty my head, relax and have a clearer view of my current plans and aspirations.</p> <p>In my journaling journey, I’ve found that the internet is a great tool for finding interesting journaling methods, each oriented towards a different goal. Like bullet journaling for managing your tasks and projects, or commonplace books for keeping track of things you’ve learned.</p> <p>But today I want to share with you a journaling method that is not so popular but definitely deserves more attention. This method is supported by research to have a great impact in balancing your emotional and mental health. All the resources and bibliography for this post can be found below.</p> <p>This post is part of a three-post series on journaling that I will be doing on journaling.</p> <p>A quick disclaimer before I start, I am not a health professional. I am just a pre-med student really interested in psychology, sharing some things on the internet. Please consult a health professional if you’re suffering from PTSD, depression, anxiety or any of the things we are going to talk about.</p> <h1 id="how-to-do-it">How to do it</h1> <p>The Pennebaker journaling method was developed by the American psychologist and James Pennebaker and is one of the most well-documented journaling methods in psychology literature there is.</p> <p>It has been show to promote the reduction of post-traumatic stress symptoms and depression in studies done with veterans, as well as an improvement of immune system functionality and a consequent decrease in general health problems. Dr. Andrew Huberman has a full video on the Pennebaker method which I really recommend watching, and can be found together with the other sources.</p> <p>The practice goes as follows:</p> <p>Sit down in a private place with no distractions or interruptions; Write for a period of 15–20 minutes; Write about a traumatic or emotional experience that is not too recent, to avoid negative rumination; Write freely and without censoring about any facts, feelings, or thoughts that arise regarding the event; Be as true as you can about what happened, what you felt, and what you think about it; Repeat 2–4 times. You can do it in consecutive days or in the span of a month. This journaling method can be done with the assistance of a therapist, but still keeps most of the strength of its effects without the presence of one, which is an important note for those who for one reason or another can’t provide themselves with a therapist.</p> <h1 id="how-it-works">How it works</h1> <p>But how does the Pennebaker method work? How does it affect your stress levels and immune response? When you experience a traumatic event, like, for example, a car crash, you have to react very quickly, giving little time for your rational mind to make a proper assessment of the situation. This physically corresponds to a decrease in the levels of activity of your neocortex, responsible for your conscious thoughts, and an increase in the activity of your limbic system, responsible for emotional responses and your fight-flight-freeze mechanisms.</p> <p>Now, your brain is an incredibly intelligent machine. The memory of what happened during the event and how you reacted will be kept in order to help you prevent such a situation and react more quickly if it ever were to happen again. The problem is that sometimes, this adaptive system can go beyond what is necessary to protect your life and create trauma that will lead to higher levels of stress and the possibility of developing problems such as PTSD, chronic anxiety or depression. In the car crash example, a person could start feeling anxious anytime they are near a car.</p> <p>Even worse, in some situations where trauma was caused within a relationship, the person’s concept of self and self-worth may be at stake. For example, if someone was a victim of violence from an abusive partner, the way that emotionally interpreted their role during that event can stay stuck in their minds, impacting the way they see themselves after the situation has passed.</p> <p>This is where the Pennebaker method comes into play. The act of reminiscing and writing about a traumatic event in a context of safety, openness, and vulnerability allows for a reinterpretation of what really happened, the role the person played, and how this should shape their view of themselves and of the world. This happens through three main mechanisms:</p> <p>First, the person is making a conscious effort to rationally understand what was going on, engaging more of their neocortex and less of their limbic system at each retelling of the story. Second, the stress released by recalling the memory will provoke an increase in neuroplasticity, which is the ability of your brain to physically adapt and change its connections when learning something. It’s like metal, which, when exposed to the right levels of heat, becomes pliable and can then be more easily shaped. Third, the space between sessions allows the brain to consolidate these new changes during sleep and make them long-lasting.</p> <p>Thus, the Pennebaker journaling method is essentially helping you replace that initial very stressing and emotionally charged memory by a more neutral and rationally coherent one that will still function to help you avoid or react to similar situations in the future. Basically, it’s like your brain had very quickly set up a very loud and sensitive emergency alarm at the moment of the traumatic event, and by reassessing what happened, you’re able to tune the alarm in a way that it still works, but without disrupting your daily life.</p> <p>This helps you decrease your overall levels of chronic stress and cortisol, and thus, decrease the levels of inflammation throughout your body. This decrease in inflammation then alleviates symptoms of many types of immune diseases such as asthma, arthritis, or cystic fibrosis. It also helps with the symptoms of other stress-related problems, such as poor sleep and pain perception.</p> <h1 id="warnings">Warnings</h1> <p>There are two important things to keep in mind to prevent harm from happening to oneself or to others when practicing this method. The first is that a presence of overwhelming negative feelings and ruminating thoughts may suggest that the memory is still too fresh or too emotionally charged to be dealt with right now. It is best to stop, do something soothing, wait a while and seek professional attention before trying to do the method again. Stress, sadness, anger and negative feelings are normal when writing about traumatic memories, but they shouldn’t cause despair or start affecting your daily life.</p> <p>Also, be very careful if you want to share your writings with someone else, since sharing about trauma can be very stressful for the person you’re sharing with, and their negative reactions can make you resent or feel ashamed for trying to reevaluate your traumatic experiences.</p> <p>In conclusion, the Pennebaker method is a short and resource-cheap journaling system that can have a great impact in your mental health and well-being. It costs basically nothing except a little bit of your time, while having little negative effects since you can stop at any time. I really recommend trying it out, or sharing it with someone who might need.</p> <h1 id="bibliography">Bibliography</h1> <p><a href="https://www.va.gov/WHOLEHEALTHLIBRARY/docs/Therapeutic-Journaling.pdf">“Therapeutic Journaling,” n.d.</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAZn9dF3XTo">“A Science-Supported Journaling Protocol to Improve Mental &amp; Physical Health” - Andrew Huberman - YouTube</a></p> <h1 id="further-reading">Further reading</h1> <p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3759583/">Krpan, Katherine M., Ethan Kross, Marc G.

In December, we launched our first natively multimodal model Gemini 1.0 in three sizes: Ultra, Pro and Nano. Just a few months later we released 1.5 Pro, with enhanced performance and a breakthrough long context window of 1 million tokens.Developers and enterprise customers have been putting 1.5 Pro to use in incredible ways and finding its long context window, multimodal reasoning capabilities and impressive overall performance incredibly useful.We know from user feedback that some applications need lower latency and a lower cost to serve. This inspired us to keep innovating, so today, we’re introducing Gemini 1.5 Flash: a model that’s lighter-weight than 1.5 Pro, and designed to be fast and efficient to serve at scale.Both 1.5 Pro and 1.5 Flash are available in public preview with a 1 million token context window in Google AI Studio and Vertex AI. And now, 1.5 Pro is also available with a 2 million token context window via waitlist to developers using the API and to Google Cloud customers.We’re also introducing updates across the Gemini family of models, announcing our next generation of open models, Gemma 2, and sharing progress on the future of AI assistants, with Project Astra.Context lengths of leading foundation models compared with Gemini 1.5’s 2 million token capability1.5 Flash is the newest addition to the Gemini model family and the fastest Gemini model served in the API. It’s optimized for high-volume, high-frequency tasks at scale, is more cost-efficient to serve and features our breakthrough long context window.While it’s a lighter weight model than 1.5 Pro, it’s highly capable of multimodal reasoning across vast amounts of information and delivers impressive quality for its size.The new Gemini 1.5 Flash model is optimized for speed and efficiency, is highly capable of multimodal reasoning and features our breakthrough long context window.1.5 Flash excels at summarization, chat applications, image and video captioning, data extraction from long documents and tables, and more. This is because it’s been trained by 1.5 Pro through a process called “distillation,” where the most essential knowledge and skills from a larger model are transferred to a smaller, more efficient model.Read more about 1.5 Flash in our updated Gemini 1.5 technical report, on the Gemini technology page, and learn about 1.5 Flash’s availability and pricing.Over the last few months, we’ve significantly improved 1.5 Pro, our best model for general performance across a wide range of tasks.Beyond extending its context window to 2 million tokens, we’ve enhanced its code generation, logical reasoning and planning, multi-turn conversation, and audio and image understanding through data and algorithmic advances. We see strong improvements on public and internal benchmarks for each of these tasks.1.5 Pro can now follow increasingly complex and nuanced instructions, including ones that specify product-level behavior involving role, format and style. We’ve improved control over the model’s responses for specific use cases, like crafting the persona and response style of a chat agent or automating workflows through multiple function calls. And we’ve enabled users to steer model behavior by setting system instructions.We added audio understanding in the Gemini API and Google AI Studio, so 1.5 Pro can now reason across image and audio for videos uploaded in Google AI Studio. And we’re now integrating 1.5 Pro into Google products, including Gemini Advanced and in Workspace apps.Read more about 1.5 Pro in our updated Gemini 1.5 technical report and on the Gemini technology page.Gemini Nano is expanding beyond text-only inputs to include images as well. Starting with Pixel, applications using Gemini Nano with Multimodality will be able to understand the world the way people do — not just through text, but also through sight, sound and spoken language.Read more about Gemini 1.0 Nano on Android.Today, we’re also sharing a series of updates to Gemma, our family of open models built from the same research and technology used to create the Gemini models.We’re announcing Gemma 2, our next generation of open models for responsible AI innovation. Gemma 2 has a new architecture designed for breakthrough performance and efficiency, and will be available in new sizes.The Gemma family is also expanding with PaliGemma, our first vision-language model inspired by PaLI-3. And we’ve upgraded our Responsible Generative AI Toolkit with LLM Comparator for evaluating the quality of model responses.Read more on the Developer blog.As part of Google DeepMind’s mission to build AI responsibly to benefit humanity, we’ve always wanted to develop universal AI agents that can be helpful in everyday life. That’s why today, we’re sharing our progress in building the future of AI assistants with Project Astra (advanced seeing and talking responsive agent).To be truly useful, an agent needs to understand and respond to the complex and dynamic world just like people do — and take in and remember what it sees and hears to understand context and take action. It also needs to be proactive, teachable and personal, so users can talk to it naturally and without lag or delay.While we’ve made incredible progress developing AI systems that can understand multimodal information, getting response time down to something conversational is a difficult engineering challenge. Over the past few years, we’ve been working to improve how our models perceive, reason and converse to make the pace and quality of interaction feel more natural.Building on Gemini, we’ve developed prototype agents that can process information faster by continuously encoding video frames, combining the video and speech input into a timeline of events, and caching this information for efficient recall.By leveraging our leading speech models, we also enhanced how they sound, giving the agents a wider range of intonations. These agents can better understand the context they’re being used in, and respond quickly, in conversation.With technology like this, it’s easy to envision a future where people could have an expert AI assistant by their side, through a phone or glasses. And some of these capabilities are coming to Google products, like the Gemini app and web experience, later this year.We’ve made incredible progress so far with our family of Gemini models, and we’re always striving to advance the state-of-the-art even further. By investing in a relentless production line of innovation, we’re able to explore new ideas at the frontier, while also unlocking the possibility of new and exciting Gemini use cases.Learn more about Gemini and its capabilities.
