My name is Lucas Galdino. I'm a Brazilian-Canadian student of biomedical
engineering and data science living in Portugal. I also play music and am an
Orthodox Christian. Welcome to my personal website and blog.

This place is both my portfolio and personal blog. Here, you can find links to
various coding and academic projects, as well as articles and videos on topics
that interest me. In this website, and in my YouTube channel, we'll explore
topics on the intersection of coding and health, with maybe a pinch of
philosophy here and there. If that interests you, I hope you might find my
content informative or enjoyable.
